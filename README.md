# Template_Matching
<br><br>
 The project is about Object Detection.
 <br><br>
Template matching is a technique in digital image processing for finding small parts of an image which match a template image. 
It can be used in manufacturing as a part of quality control, a way to navigate a mobile robot, or as a way to detect edges in images. 
The project has been created for this mission.
